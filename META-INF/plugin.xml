Runs JiBX binding compiler after the
javac compiler has run.

All the hard work was originally done
by Jerome Bernard (jerome.bernard@kalixia.com)

Runs the JiBX binding compiler after a compile.
Automatically figures out what files are
JiBX files by using the following regex:
^.*/src/main/.*jibx.*/.*\.xml$

TODO
* Implement completion on class fields
  in JiBX mapping file
* Implement navigation from JiBX mapping
  file to class/fields.
* Update to use the latest version of JiBX
* Add java code references to the JiBX bindings
  files (i.e., when searching for usages of a
  field IDEA will show it as being used by JiBX)
* Improve detection of JiBX files
* Add config that lists all the files and allows
  some to be deselected
* Implement feature that will re-run the JiBX files
  auto detection [work done by jerome]
* Implement annotator that will annotate the
  JiBX file and provide file validation
  (classes, methods, etc) [work done by jerome]
* If it is a maven project that has the
  maven JiBX plugin installed then determine files
  by inspecting the pom
